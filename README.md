## Recovery plans overview analysis

The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to develop plans to guide the recovery of ESA-listed species. We scraped the entirety of FWS's [ECOS website](http://ecos.fws.gov), and manually curated data from NMFS's [recovery plan site](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/recovery/plans.htm) to analyze how recovery planning has proceeded over the past 38 years. 

This R package is a wrapper for an R vignette (with "Material Design" styling) with the analysis, which we present as a working paper [on our development site](https://defend-esc-dev.org/working_papers/recovery_plan_analysis.html). It depends on another package, `ecosscraper`, which we'll be releasing in the near future. (That is, for now, visit [this page](https://defend-esc-dev.org/working_papers/recovery_plan_analysis.html) to see the end-product, but clone this repo to review the code.)
