## Recovery plans overview analysis

The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to develop plans to guide the recovery of ESA-listed species. There have been few program-wide analyses of the status of ESA recovery plans (e.g., completeness, timeliness, age), and those that have been done tended to focus on one aspects of plan status. To address this gap, we scraped the entirety of FWS's [ECOS website](http://ecos.fws.gov), and manually curated data from NMFS's [recovery plan site](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/recovery/plans.htm) to analyze how recovery planning has proceeded over the past 38 years. This R package is a wrapper for a vignette with the analysis, which we present as a working paper [on our development site](https://cci-dev.org/working_papers/recovery_plan_overview/).
